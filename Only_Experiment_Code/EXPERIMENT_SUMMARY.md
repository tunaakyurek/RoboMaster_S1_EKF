# RoboMaster S1 Direct Execution Experiment - Summary

## 🎯 Objective
Explore the possibility of running custom Python code, including a simplified EKF, directly on the RoboMaster S1's internal computing unit without requiring an external Raspberry Pi.

## 🔍 Research Findings

### Hardware Specifications
