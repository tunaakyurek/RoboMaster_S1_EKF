    x = x + K * y (state update)
    P = (I - K * H) * P * (I - K * H)^T + K * R * K^T (covariance update)
    """
    # Innovation
    y = z - h
    
    # Innovation covariance
    S = H @ self.P @ H.T + R
    
    # Kalman gain
    K = self.P @ H.T @ np.linalg.inv(S)

        [cr*sp*cy + sr*sy, cr*sp*sy - sr*cy, cr*cp]
    ])
    
    return R

## Platform-Specific Adaptations

### 1. Raspberry Pi Main EKF (`src/ekf/ekf_core.py`)

Implements a 12D EKF skeleton with IMU, chassis, GPS, and magnetometer hooks. Used by `src/main.py` integration path.

### 2. iPhone Integration EKF (`iphone_integration/pi_phone_connection/ekf_robomaster_8dof.py`)

Implements an 8-DOF planar EKF specialized for ground vehicles with yaw-observability fixes (GPS-course yaw, magnetometer yaw, NHC, ZUPT, ZARU). Used by `iphone_integration/pi_phone_connection/main_integration_robomaster.py`.

## Sensor Fusion Strategy

### Formulary Specification

The EKF relies **solely on sensor measurements** as specified in the formulary:

1. **IMU (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)**: Primary orientation and motion estimation
2. **Chassis Encoders**: Position and velocity validation
3. **GPS** (when available): Absolute position reference
4. **Magnetometer** (when available): Absolute heading reference
5. **Barometer** (when available): Altitude estimation

### Implementation Compliance
In `src/ekf/ekf_core.py`, `process_sensor_data` follows the formulary update order. In the iPhone EKF, IMU drives prediction; absolute heading and constraint updates enforce yaw observability.

## Noise Parameters

### Formulary Specification

Process and measurement noise covariances as specified in the formulary:

```python
# Process Noise Covariance Q as per Formulary
Q_POSITION = 0.01    # Position uncertainty
Q_VELOCITY = 0.1     # Velocity uncertainty  
Q_ORIENTATION = 0.05 # Orientation uncertainty
Q_ANGULAR_VEL = 0.1  # Angular velocity uncertainty

# Measurement Noise Covariance R as per Formulary
R_ACCEL = 0.5        # Accelerometer noise
R_GYRO = 0.1         # Gyroscope noise
R_CHASSIS = 0.05     # Chassis encoder noise
```

### Implementation Compliance

All implementations use the same noise parameters as specified in the formulary, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms.

## Physical Constants

### Formulary Specification

```python
# Physical Constants as per Formulary
GRAVITY = 9.81       # m/s²
MAG_DECLINATION = 0.0  # Magnetic declination (to be calibrated)
```

### Implementation Compliance

All implementations use the same physical constants as specified in the formulary.

## Angle Normalization

### Formulary Specification

Angles must be normalized to `[-π, π]` for consistent representation.

### Implementation Compliance

```python
def _normalize_angles(self, angles):
    """
    Normalize angles to [-π, π] as per formulary
    Ensures consistent angle representation
    """
    return (angles + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi) - np.pi
```
