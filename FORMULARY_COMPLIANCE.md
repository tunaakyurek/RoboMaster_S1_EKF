## Sensor Fusion Strategy

### Formulary Specification

The EKF relies **solely on sensor measurements** as specified in the formulary:

1. **IMU (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)**: Primary orientation and motion estimation
2. **Chassis Encoders**: Position and velocity validation
3. **GPS** (when available): Absolute position reference
4. **Magnetometer** (when available): Absolute heading reference
5. **Barometer** (when available): Altitude estimation

### Implementation Compliance

```python
def process_sensor_data(self, sensor_data):
    """
    Process all available sensor data as per formulary
    Follows the sensor fusion strategy outlined in the formulary
    """
    # Update with available sensors as per formulary
    if sensor_data.accel is not None and sensor_data.gyro is not None:
        self.update_imu(sensor_data.accel, sensor_data.gyro)
    
    if sensor_data.mag is not None:
        self.update_magnetometer(sensor_data.mag)
    
    if all(x is not None for x in [sensor_data.gps_lat, sensor_data.gps_lon, sensor_data.gps_alt]):
        self.update_gps(sensor_data.gps_lat, sensor_data.gps_lon, sensor_data.gps_alt)
    
    if all(x is not None for x in [sensor_data.chassis_x, sensor_data.chassis_y, sensor_data.chassis_yaw]):
        self.update_chassis(sensor_data.chassis_x, sensor_data.chassis_y, sensor_data.chassis_yaw)
```

## Noise Parameters

### Formulary Specification

Process and measurement noise covariances as specified in the formulary:

```python
# Process Noise Covariance Q as per Formulary
Q_POSITION = 0.01    # Position uncertainty
Q_VELOCITY = 0.1     # Velocity uncertainty  
Q_ORIENTATION = 0.05 # Orientation uncertainty
Q_ANGULAR_VEL = 0.1  # Angular velocity uncertainty

# Measurement Noise Covariance R as per Formulary
R_ACCEL = 0.5        # Accelerometer noise
R_GYRO = 0.1         # Gyroscope noise
R_CHASSIS = 0.05     # Chassis encoder noise
```

### Implementation Compliance

All implementations use the same noise parameters as specified in the formulary, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms.

## Physical Constants

### Formulary Specification

```python
# Physical Constants as per Formulary
GRAVITY = 9.81       # m/s²
MAG_DECLINATION = 0.0  # Magnetic declination (to be calibrated)
```

### Implementation Compliance

All implementations use the same physical constants as specified in the formulary.

## Angle Normalization

### Formulary Specification

Angles must be normalized to `[-π, π]` for consistent representation.

### Implementation Compliance

```python
def _normalize_angles(self, angles):
    """
    Normalize angles to [-π, π] as per formulary
    Ensures consistent angle representation
    """
    return (angles + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi) - np.pi
```
