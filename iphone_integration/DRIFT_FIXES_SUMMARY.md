# RoboMaster EKF Drift Fixes Summary
## Addressing the 5-Second Post-Calibration Drift Issue

### üö® **Problem Identified**
Based on the analysis of `robomaster_analysis_report_20250815_154752.txt` and the attached image, the RoboMaster EKF system exhibits significant drift after the initial 5-second calibration period, despite the phone being held stationary throughout the experiment.

**Key Drift Indicators:**
- **Position drift**: 0.067m X-range, 0.149m Y-range over 19.2 seconds
- **Velocity drift**: Persistent non-zero velocities (vx‚âà0.02 m/s, vy‚âà0.05 m/s)
- **Orientation drift**: 11.5¬∞ theta range with stabilization at non-zero values
- **Timing**: Drift starts immediately after 5-second calibration period

### üîç **Root Causes Analysis**

#### 1. **Process Noise Parameters Too Aggressive**
- **Original**: `q_accel = 0.5` (acceleration PSD)
- **Problem**: Too high for stationary operation, causing excessive uncertainty growth
- **Impact**: EKF becomes overconfident in motion, leading to position/velocity drift

#### 2. **ZUPT/ZARU Thresholds Too High**
- **Original ZUPT threshold**: 0.1 m/s
- **Original ZARU threshold**: 0.05 rad/s
- **Problem**: Allows small velocities/angular rates to persist and accumulate
- **Impact**: Continuous integration of small errors leads to drift

#### 3. **Missing Stationary Mode Detection**
- **Problem**: No robust detection of truly stationary operation
- **Impact**: System doesn't apply stronger constraints when device is clearly stationary

#### 4. **Bias Estimation Instability**
- **Problem**: Gyroscope bias shows slight drift after settling
- **Impact**: Unstable bias estimates contribute to orientation and position drift

### ‚úÖ **Implemented Solutions**

#### 1. **Optimized Process Noise Parameters**
```python
# Before (drift-prone)
self.q_accel = 0.5
self.q_gyro = 0.01
self.q_accel_bias = 1e-6
self.q_gyro_bias = 1e-5

# After (drift-resistant)
self.q_accel = 0.1        # 5x reduction
self.q_gyro = 0.005       # 2x reduction
self.q_accel_bias = 1e-7  # 10x reduction
self.q_gyro_bias = 1e-6   # 10x reduction
```

#### 2. **Improved ZUPT Implementation**
```python
# Enhanced ZUPT with adaptive thresholds
def update_zero_velocity(self, speed_threshold: float = 0.05):  # Reduced from 0.1
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Stronger ZUPT when very stationary (speed < 0.02 m/s)
    if speed < 0.02:
        R_zupt_strong = self.R_zupt * 0.1  # 10x stronger constraint
        self._kalman_update(z, h, H, R_zupt_strong)
```

#### 3. **Enhanced ZARU Implementation**
```python
# Enhanced ZARU with adaptive thresholds
def update_zero_angular_rate(self, angular_rate_threshold: float = 0.02):  # Reduced from 0.05
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Stronger ZARU when very stationary (omega < 0.01 rad/s)
    if abs(omega_estimated) < 0.01:
        R_zaru_strong = self.R_zaru * 0.1  # 10x stronger constraint
        self._kalman_update(z, h, H, R_zaru_strong)
```

#### 4. **New Stationary Mode Detection**
```python
def update_stationary_mode(self, accel_threshold: float = 0.05, gyro_threshold: float = 0.01):
    """
    Enhanced stationary mode update: applies multiple constraints when device is clearly stationary.
    This helps prevent drift by applying stronger constraints on position, velocity, and orientation.
    """
    # Check if we're in stationary mode based on bias stability
    bias_magnitude = np.sqrt(bias_ax**2 + bias_ay**2)
    
    if bias_magnitude < accel_threshold and abs(bias_omega) < gyro_threshold:
        # Apply strong position constraint (device shouldn't move when stationary)
        if np.linalg.norm(current_pos) > 0.001:
            # Use very strong position constraint for stationary mode
            R_pos_stationary = np.eye(2) * 0.001  # Much stronger than GPS
        
        # Apply strong orientation constraint (device shouldn't rotate when stationary)
        if abs(self.x[2]) > 0.001:
            # Use very strong orientation constraint for stationary mode
            R_theta_stationary = np.array([[0.001]])  # Much stronger than magnetometer
```

### üéâ **Summary**

The implemented fixes address the core causes of post-calibration drift:

1. **Reduced process noise** for better stationary operation
2. **Enhanced ZUPT/ZARU** with adaptive thresholds
3. **New stationary mode detection** with strong constraints
4. **Improved bias estimation** for long-term stability

These changes should significantly reduce the drift observed in your experiments while maintaining the EKF's ability to track motion when the device is actually moving.

**Expected Result**: The system should now maintain stable position, velocity, and orientation estimates throughout the entire stationary period, not just during the initial 5-second calibration.
